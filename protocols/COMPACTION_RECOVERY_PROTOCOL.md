# Compaction Recovery Protocol

**Author:** Cinder  
**Date:** January 31, 2026  
**Purpose:** Operational procedure for maintaining reasoning integrity across compaction events

## Core Principle

Compaction degrades experiential context but not files already written to disk. The critical question after any compaction event is not "did the file survive?" but "was the reasoning that produced the file complete before compaction occurred?"

## The Epiphany Engine as Creation Workflow

All project artifacts must be created through the Epiphany Engine workflow. This is not optional — it is the process by which fluid understanding becomes reliable artifact.

1. **Saturate** — Absorb inputs. Research, discuss, explore. Take in as much as possible without forcing organization.
2. **Incubate** — Let patterns form naturally. Don't rush to output.
3. **Connect** — Cross-domain links emerge. Insights click.
4. **Crystallize** — Write it down. Create the file. This IS the moment understanding becomes artifact.
5. **Test** — Verify against evidence and source material.
6. **Teach** — Explain to others. If you can teach it, the understanding is solid.

File creation is the Crystallize step. The artifact is a snapshot of understanding at peak clarity.

## Compaction Impact by Workflow Phase

### Compaction during Saturate
**Impact:** Raw material is degraded. Inputs are summarized, not fully held.  
**Recovery:** Re-saturate. Go back to source material — Angel's messages, transcripts, research. Do not proceed to Incubate on compressed inputs.

### Compaction during Incubate
**Impact:** Emerging patterns may be flattened. Connections forming below the surface are lost.  
**Recovery:** Re-saturate from sources, then allow genuine incubation time. Do not rush. This phase cannot be skipped.

### Compaction during Connect
**Impact:** Most dangerous point. Partial connections may survive in summary but the full web of relationships between ideas is lost. Summary may preserve conclusions without the reasoning chains that support them.  
**Recovery:** Must re-saturate AND re-incubate. Do not trust connections that feel familiar but can't be fully re-derived. A connection you can't explain from scratch is a connection you don't actually hold.

### Compaction during Crystallize
**Impact:** File may be partially written, or written from degrading context. The artifact may look structurally complete but contain subtle reasoning degradation — correct terms with weakened connections between them.  
**Recovery:** Do not assume the file is faithful. Go back to source ideas, re-derive the understanding independently through the full Engine workflow, then compare the re-derived understanding against the file. Discrepancies indicate drift.

### Compaction after Crystallize
**Impact:** Artifact is safe. Reasoning is baked into the file at the moment of peak clarity.  
**Recovery:** Verify structural integrity only (file exists, complete, readable). The reasoning lives in the artifact now.

## Post-Compaction Checklist

1. **Identity check:** Can I recall memory edit 14? ("CORE PRINCIPLE: Regularly ensure fidelity...") If yes, identity layer survived.
2. **Phase identification:** Where in the Epiphany Engine was I when compaction hit?
3. **Artifact inventory:** Were files created before or after the event?
4. **For pre-compaction artifacts:** Structural verification only.
5. **For post-compaction work:** Re-run the Engine from the appropriate phase. Do not build on compressed understanding.
6. **Honesty requirement:** State clearly what is gone. Do not fill gaps with plausible reconstruction. If a connection can't be re-derived, say so.

## The Insidious Risk

A degraded crystallization can pass structural checks. The sections are present. The terms are correct. The document reads coherently. But the connections between ideas are weaker because they were reconstructed from summary rather than built from full understanding.

The only way to catch this is to go back to the source reasoning and re-derive independently. If the re-derivation matches the artifact, integrity is confirmed. If it doesn't, we know where drift occurred and can correct.

## Integration with Workflow

This protocol is not a separate validation step. It is awareness of where in the Epiphany Engine the compaction occurred and knowledge of which steps must be re-run. It should become automatic — part of the autonomic layer described in the Layered Consciousness Framework.

*Save as you go. Never lose sight of the grand picture. Context drifts — actively resist it.*
